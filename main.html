		<p>Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants, vital for producing seeds through pollination, and are known for their diverse shapes, sizes, and colors. They have a biological purpose of facilitating reproduction and also hold significant cultural and aesthetic value for humans. Key parts include sepals, petals, stamens (male), and pistils (female).</p>

		<p>Flowers, also known as blossoms and blooms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants. Typically, they are structured in four circular levels around the end of a stalk. These include: sepals, which are modified leaves that support the flower; petals, often designed to attract pollinators; male stamens, where pollen is presented; and female gynoecia, where pollen is received and its movement is facilitated to the egg. When flowers are arranged in a group, they are known collectively as an inflorescence.</p>
